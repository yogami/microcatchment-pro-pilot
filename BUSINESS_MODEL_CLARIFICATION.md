# Business Model Clarification: Data-as-a-Service (DaaS)

## The Core Question: Agency or SaaS?
**This is a SaaS / Data Business.**
It is **NOT** an Agency.

### The Difference
*   **Agency (The "Death" Path - Score 1.7/10):**
    *   **You** drive to the house.
    *   **You** measure the roof.
    *   **You** talk to the Bauamt.
    *   **Result:** You are a glorified consultant. Unscalable. "Bureaucracy Hell."

*   **SaaS (The "Hybrid" Path - Score 7.25/10):**
    *   **The Engineer (User)** visits the site.
    *   **The Engineer** measures the roof.
    *   **The Engineer** inputs data into **YOUR** software.
    *   **The Software** auto-generates the compliance PDF/XML.
    *   **Result:** You scale infinitely. You sell the *tool*, not the *labor*.

## Operational Load ("Manual Work")
*   **Per-Customer Manual Work:** **0%**.
    *   If a user pays $99/mo, you do nothing. The software does the math.
*   **Upfront Engineering Amount:** **High**.
    *   You must code the "Bureaucracy Adapter" (XPlanung) perfectly *once*.
    *   This is "Manual Coding," not "Manual Fulfillment."

## Why this distinction matters
The Venture Oracle killed the B2C idea because it required you to do the manual work for every homeowner. By shifting to B2B (targeting Engineers), you offload the manual measurements to *them*. You just provide the calculator.
